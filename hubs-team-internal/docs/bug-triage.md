## Internal Bug Triage

This list of bugs and feature improvements was created by @mikemorran in December 2023 after conversations with key community members and backlog review. This list was generated with our community in mind; The Hubs team wanted to devote more time to interfacing with community feature/improvement requests and establish a pipeline of report -> triage -> fix -> follow-through.

Prioritization should be treated as arbitrary by future readers. This list was compiled at the same time as the bitECS rewrite was nearing completion, so several items may already be captured/completed.
