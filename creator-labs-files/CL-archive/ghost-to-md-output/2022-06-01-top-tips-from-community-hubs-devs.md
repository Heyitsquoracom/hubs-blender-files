In the past few months, we have seen an increasing number of people and groups forking Mozilla Hubs, making modifications and [extending Hubs](__GHOST_URL__/extending-hubs-with-hubs-cloud/) in various ways. I asked some of our community developers what tips they wish they were given before diving into the Mozilla Hubs code base?

For example did you know you can use the chat command `/duck` to quickly bring in a 3D object in the scene for testing and debugging?

If you are just getting started, check out these bits of advice and tips from developers in the Hubs community:

**Rupert Rawnsely | **CTO [Avantis](https://twitter.com/AvantisEd)
You can pull the client code and run against the dev server with no need to spin up a Hubs Cloud.

**Louis Blesch**
Understand the difference between [running the local client](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs#quick-start) against hubs dev servers `npm run dev` and [a hubs cloud instance](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-custom-clients.html) with `npm run start`

**Micheal Morran | **Mozilla Hubs |[OnboardXR](https://twitter.com/onboardxr)
Fabien Benetou's [tools for prototyping and debugging](https://fabien.benetou.fr/Tools/Hubs) helped me get started a year and a half ago.

**Justin Colangelo | **[StandardMagic](https://standardmagic.com/)
Following along in that [deploy.js file](https://github.dev/mozilla/hubs/blob/93edcf2ad1a8089732d70c0d354a09b5aea6bdde/scripts/deploy.js#L1) was helpful. We've customized that to post to Discord/Slack/whatever kind of deploy channels we've set up.

The admin area server settings advanced tab can be tricky (it is called Advanced for a reason).

If you need additional backend functionality or data storage but don't want to get into customizing reticulum, try looking at [lamdba functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and connecting to services that way.

This diagram is also helpful to get an overview: [System Overview](https://github.com/albirrkarim/mozilla-hubs-installation-detailed/blob/main/docs_img/System_Overview.png)

Markus also created [Awesome Mozilla Hubs](https://github.com/hubs-creators/awesome-mozilla-hubs) ‚≠êÔ∏è A fantastic list of resources.

I found [this article](https://github.com/kou029w/zenn.dev/blob/master/articles/hubs-custom-reticulum.md) on reticulum customization very helpful.
