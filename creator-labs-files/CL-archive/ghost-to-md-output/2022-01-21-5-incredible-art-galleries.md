Whether you're an artist showcasing work for a global audience, amateur photographer, or a 3D modeler hosting live tours of your portfolioâ€“ Hubs is a great place to show off your art.

Galleries in Mozilla Hubs are unique because they:

- Allow artist to send links to a space accessible cross-platform without having to download any special software.
- Enable people to come together and celebrate art for live tours and opening parties.
- Are accessible 24/7 around the globe.
- Allow experienced artists and developers to customize the environment however they would like.

If you're just starting out with creating these kinds of spaces, you can check out the [Modular Art Gallery](https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/jOIjUE0/hubs-modular-art-gallery), a pre-built gallery you can customize in [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke).
