Launch your world with Hubs Professional plan, a hosted service provided by Mozilla Hubs that allows your team to host Hubs on your own domain, with your own customized Hubs!  Hubs has been an extensible, open-source platform for virtual worlds on the web for more than five years but setting up the infrastructure required has been a major pain point for many developing their own features and modifying Hubs to fit their project needs. With Professional plan, we enter a new era of ease and convenience in deploying your own branded versions of Hubs available in [33 countries](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/setup-choosing.html#supported-regions) for $79 per month. If you would like to try out the Hubs subscription service first, we have a free [Starter plan](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#subscribe) that is available to all regions.
