**Before you do any writing**, propose an article here:

Once your proposal has been submitted, we will aim to send you an approval or a rejection within one week. Proposals that are incomplete will be have to be resubmitted. For a successful proposal, please answer the questions on the form.

If approved, you will be invited to Creator Labs via email where you can set up your author profile and begin your draft post directly on the creator labs site. We will coordinate feedback and updates via a [discord](https://discord.gg/sBMqSjCndj) thread in #creator-labs.

We welcome contributors to include links to their socials, personal portfolios/websites on their author profile page.

Once you have completed your draft, let the team know and it will be reviewed by the Hubs team. We will endeavor to review it within 2 weeks from the draft completion date. Â The draft may or may not require revisions.

The Hubs team will make the decision to deny and accept proposals. If your proposal and draft are accepted and published, you are under no obligation to actively update or maintain articles. The Hubs team might un-publish posts to keep content as accurate and timely as possible.

## Creator Labs Style Guide

### Components

There are several useful components we use when writing posts we would like to encourage you all to use freely as you see fit. Â You can use the built in components inside your draft by using the `+` button you will see on new lines. Typing `/` on a new line will also trigger this menu.

### Images, Videos and Image Galleries

We want to be as visual as possible in Creator Labs so we encourage you to use many images and videos to help illustrate your point. Please ensure you appropriately credit and attribute any content you include in your post and you have the rights to use it.

You can upload videos and embed videos hosted on other sites as well.
