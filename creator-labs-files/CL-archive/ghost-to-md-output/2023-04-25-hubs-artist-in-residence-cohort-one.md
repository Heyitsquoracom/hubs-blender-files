The Hubs Artist in Residence (H.A.I.R) Program was conceived as a way to incentivize artists through grants, allowing them to explore and showcase the potential of open-source tools and the accessible open web. By generously giving their work back to the community, these artists have helped encourage a thriving, creative ecosystem.

When we [first launched this program](__GHOST_URL__/mozilla-hubs-artist-in-residence-program/), we were overwhelmed by the response. Hundreds of talented artists applied and we had the difficult task of choosing just six seats we had available. We [welcomed our first cohort](__GHOST_URL__/welcoming-new-hubs-artist-in-residence/) to test the Hubs Blender art pipeline, embrace the challenges of creating performant art on the web, and share their progress and tutorials with the Hubs community.

Get started building worlds with these tutorials from Hubs Artist in Residence [Pedro Valencia](__GHOST_URL__/author/theanine3d/) and [Tanya Perez](__GHOST_URL__/building-a-vr-world-from-scratch-a-beginners-journey-into-hubs/)

HAIR marks a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to enrich and empower the immersive web. In the true spirit of collaboration and creativity, the artists' work is available in the Hubs Blender files [github repository](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-blender-files) under a Creative Commons license for others to remix and use in their own projects. This will allow web and 3D creators to freely use the work of HAIR, further benefiting the larger creator community.

Scroll below for some of the creations these artists have built over the past four months as they learned more about Hubs, the [Hubs Blender Add-on](__GHOST_URL__/what-is-the-blender-add-on/), and pushed themselves to grow through their works.
