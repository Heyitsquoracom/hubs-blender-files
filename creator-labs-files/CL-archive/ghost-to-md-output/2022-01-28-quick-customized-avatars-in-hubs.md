Looking to create your own custom avatar but not sure where to start? The following tools make it easy to create 3D models you can use in [Mozilla Hubs](hubs.mozilla.com).

Hubs is unique in that it lets you upload and use your own 3D assets -- but building them from scratch can be a bit challenging for new users (we'll cover this in a future Creator Labs post). The avatar makers highlighted below are helpful because they offer a range of avatars that can be personalized using easy-to-use interfaces.

To use your custom avatar, you can link to it in hubs or upload the .glb file exported from the avatar maker. You can find the specific steps to upload custom avatars here: [https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/intro-avatars.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/intro-avatars.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1647546388630107&usg=AOvVaw2IQUlZYbYJoLfO-10hWJnN)
