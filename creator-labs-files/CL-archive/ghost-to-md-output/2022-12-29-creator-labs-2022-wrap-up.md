As the year comes to a close, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the most popular Hubs Creator Labs posts of the year. In this year-end review, we'll highlight the top posts of 2022 and share some insights on what made them so popular. Whether you're new to Hubs Creator Labs or have been following us for a while, we hope this retrospective will give you a chance to catch up on some of the most viewed content we've published in the past year.

## Top 5 Tutorials

[Jim](__GHOST_URL__/author/jco/) and [Jordan](__GHOST_URL__/author/jordan/) led us in 2022 with the most viewed tutorials. Unsurprisingly, the top tutorials by page view have to do with light baking, a notoriously complicated process in 2022.  At number three, the multi-part tutorials around UV scrolling textures made for much better performance and gave more life and energy to our Hubs spaces. We received a lot of good feedback in the [Hubs discord](https://discord.gg/hubs-498741086295031808) and tutorials have been a great driver to help improve experiences in Hubs.

## Top 5 Inspirational

Inspirational posts have a broad appeal and help provide context for how people are using Hubs and explore the possibilities afforded to us on the immersive web. As an open-source project, one of Mozilla Hubs biggest strengths is the ability to customize it to your needs and people from all over the world have been tinkering with Hubs. Our top inspirational posts largely document this strength. Here are the top five by page views:

## Top 5 Tools

Tools posts refer creators to helpful applications, workflows, add-ons and websites. [Manuel's](__GHOST_URL__/author/manuel/) Blender Add-On explainer served as a powerful entry point for folks getting started in exploring the Blender workflow in Hubs in 2022. Event hosts commonly referred to the web-based avatar creation tools found in number two, and posts from this Fall about AI textures and LOD quickly became popular with our readers.
