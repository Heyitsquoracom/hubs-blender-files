_This article is a Spotlight ✨ – part of a series of interviews with innovative Hubs creators highlighting their work. Have a creator in mind that you would like us to showcase? Let us know in the #creator-labs channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sBMqSjCndj)._

[Gugenka](https://gugenka.jp/), Japan based XR creative studio specializing in 3d spaces, is doing some exciting work building on top of Hubs. We will take a look at some of their successful projects partnering with brands like [Sanrio](https://v-fes.sanrio.co.jp/en.html#), popular anime properties and large telecomm companies.

What is DOOR? Could you tell us a bit more about it?

\*_minor edits to translations made for clarity_

> "DOOR" is an XR space platform provided by NTT, launched in November 2020 as Japan's first 3D space-based owned media.  It is a platform that enables free and open communication and information dissemination that only NTT can provide. Since its launch, it has been used by many people from individuals to companies.
> In response to the difficulty of communication between people due to the new coronavirus, we started development around June 2020 and We launched the service in November 2020. Our goal was to achieve both social distance and economic revitalization.

**Why choose Hubs for the DOOR project?**

> Because we wanted to realize a multi-device platform in the browser.  Also, because we felt it was a scalable and future-proof platform.

> - No application installation required.
> - Original rooms can be created.
> - Compatible with multiple devices including PCs, smartphones, and VR devices.

> We use Blender to create the underlying buildings and use the SPOKE function to place image links, etc.

**What  advantages do you see designing 3D spaces?**

> Since sound attenuation depends on the distance, the sound when people gather together is closer to the real experience.
> The advantage of this system is that, unlike web calls where people take turns exchanging words with each other, people can visit the venue and have a "face-to-face" experience with body gesture.

## Client Customizations

> At first, we localized UI in 3D spaces to Japanese. It used custom font images. This is important for many users in Japan. Other changes included adding UI to allow for a third person view and first person, and our own mirror component. These were based on requests from users of other VR platforms (e.g. VRChat) and achieved by using experimental features of hubs.

Selected Translations:

> I myself could not do it because I did not have the skills, but I felt it was a wonderful experiment to be able to see the room I had created and to talk about it with my supporters there.

> Unlike a typical 1-on-1 conversation event, the creation of rooms and the concept of a town connected to each room was appealing because it allowed the participants to feel as if they were part of the town and living together.

> It was great to be able to interact with the other fans, which was hard to do since the real events were cancelled all over the place. The mayor's avatar was also very cute.

> I was able to talk to my guests, of course, but I was also able to interact with the same fans that I had always only seen in the comments section or Twitter reps.

> Also, it was refreshing to be able to see the enthusiasm of other fans through the open Discord, and to feel the excitement of the event as a whole.

> I thought it was great that I could participate on multiple platforms, whether on a PC or a smartphone, and that there was no need to install a separate application.

> This event was my first experience with creating a VR space, and it was more fun than I had imagined. It was also a great pleasure to see my guests come to see the rooms I created.

> The room templates and assets were well prepared and beginner-friendly, and the event was a good opportunity for me to get in touch with VR.

> I was very happy to be able to talk with them while directly introducing what I had created. This is an experience that is not often possible at regular events, and I was happy to hear the reactions of the vtubers who spoke to us. It was my first experience to prepare a room, and there were some technical difficulties, but I really enjoyed the process of creating the room and worrying about it, thinking that I could directly introduce the space I had created for my guests and have them spend time in it.
