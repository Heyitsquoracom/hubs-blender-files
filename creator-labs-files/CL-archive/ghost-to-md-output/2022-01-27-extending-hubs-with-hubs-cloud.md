We have seen some impressive customizations of Mozilla Hubs with [Hubs Cloud](https://hubs.mozilla.com/cloud) by teams of developers and 3D artists all over the world.

Let's take a look at some examples how people have modified Hubs to fit their own design and use cases:

## Virgils

Virgils offers psychotherapy in virtual spaces. Calming yet awe-inspiring scenes and non-humanoid avatars designed to reduce self-consciousness are some of the core features of the experience.

### Webspaces

When describing hubs extensibility,  [Webspaces](https://webspaces.space/introduction.html), an always-on avatar chat for 3D virtual spaces, pushes the limits. Not a hubs-cloud but a solid model of how to build off of hubs code while upholding [MPL](https://github.com/jel-app/jel-mpl).  This 'video game for work' features in-world voxel building, emoji blasters, powerful keyboard features and much [more](https://gfodor.medium.com/rebooting-the-web-in-3d-with-webspaces-9e58847e042c).
