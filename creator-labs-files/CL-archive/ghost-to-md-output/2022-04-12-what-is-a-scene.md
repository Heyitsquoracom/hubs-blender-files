Understanding the difference between a ‚Äúscene‚Äù and a ‚Äúroom‚Äù early in your Mozilla Hubs creator journey is a key concept that will save you a lot of time. The scene is your source of truth for all the rooms you create from it. Let‚Äôs take a look at how this works.

We like to use the analogy of a theater when describing the difference between a room and a scene. 

A theater is at a permanent location and provides the infrastructure for a play. Depending on the performance, you can change the look of your theater by decorating it with sets, props and lighting. Similarly, a Hubs room exists at a specific URL and is a place for people to get together in a virtual space. If you would like to change the ambiance of your room, you can decorate it by changing the scene.

When you publish a scene through Hubs environment editor [Spoke](http://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke), your scene will get its own unique url that looks something like this:

[https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/rX32zZQ/interdimensional-art-gallery](https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/rX32zZQ/interdimensional-art-gallery) (note the word ‚Äúscenes‚Äù in the middle)

One way we can create rooms, is directly from these scene links:

When you make changes to a scene and re-publish those changes in [Spoke](http://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke), the rooms created from that scene all change as well.

When you publish your scene to make an update, if there are people already in the corresponding rooms they will need to refresh their browser to receive the update.

If you are an admin in a room, you can change the scene as many times as you would like. The room URL will not change. To change the scene from within a room, check out the room settings menu.

You can also change the scene in a room using your keyboard by typing: /scene SCENE LINK URL
