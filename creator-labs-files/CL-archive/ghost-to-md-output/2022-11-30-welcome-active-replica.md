One of the most incredible things about Mozilla Hubs is the creative, dedicated community that has grown up around this organization. For every innovation we bring to the world, dozens of developers, artists, and creators from all over the world build and add to it, using their insights and skills to make Hubs  even better for more people. Sometimes, these teams  contribute to Hubs in such a fundamental way, that we want to help bring them to everyone who uses the product.

That’s exactly what Jacob Ervin, Valerian Denis, and the entire team at Active Replica have brought to Hubs. Today,  I’m excited to share that we have acquired them to help bring their experience creating compelling virtual events  to the entire Hubs community.

The magical, immersive experiences that Active Replica has built are perfectly attuned to our increasingly distributed, remote-first world. They use the power of the Hubs core engine, married to amazing content, to bring people closer together, even when we’re spending more time farther apart. From 3D development workshops to immersive theater experiences, to their contributions to Mozfest, there’s a very good chance you know the incredible work that Active Replica is capable of. And if you don’t, stop denying yourself, and [check them out](https://hubs.mozillafestival.org/) today.

Together, we see this as a key opportunity  to bring even more innovation and creativity to Hubs than we could alone. We will benefit from their unique experience and ability to create amazing experiences that help organizations use virtual spaces to drive impact. They will benefit from our scale, our talent, and our ability to help bring their innovations to the market faster.

As always, our goal is to bring these capabilities to the entire Hubs community. Bringing onboard Active Replica will help us accelerate some of our most important, in demand work, including more personalized [subscription tiers](__GHOST_URL__/mozilla-hubs-early-access-release/), improving the Hubs on-boarding experience, and introducing new interaction capabilities in the Hubs engine.

From the day I first met Jacob and Valerian, it was clear that Active Replica and Mozilla are aligned in our missions and share a basic core belief that technology has to make life better, and has to be designed from day one to serve the needs of the people who use it. I can’t wait to do that together through Hubs. Expect to hear a lot more from us soon.

Welcome to the team!
