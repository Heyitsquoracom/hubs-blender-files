Why do my avatars fly around my scene ignoring walls? Why is this spiral staircase or narrow pathway broken? The answer to these exciting mysteries may lie in your nav-mesh.

What's a nav-mesh? Nav is short for navigation and a [mesh](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/What_is_a_Mesh%3F#:~:text=A%20mesh%20is%20a%20collection,shape%20of%20a%203D%20object%3A&amp;text=(The%20plural%20of%20vertex%20is,flat%20surface%20enclosed%20by%20edges.) is another name for a 3D object. Mozilla Hubs uses nav-mesh to dictate where an avatar can go. Â Hubs doesnâ€™t recognize anything else in the scene for avatar movement, so understanding nav-mesh is crucial for controlling movement in your space.

Art Gallery nav mesh on the right highlighted in blue. Notice how the edges stop short of the walls so the avatar wonâ€™t clip through.
Check out this brief demonstration video below. See the differences between the two grey planes representing the nav-mesh? Notice how one nav mesh has a hole that prevents the avatar from clipping into the green object.

In [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke), the nav-mesh is automatically generated. Â Scenes have a floor plan you can find in the scene hierarchy. The floor plan has many properties you can use to make adjustments to the way the nav-mesh is generated.

We wonâ€™t go into detail what every one of these properties do here. You can try playing with these properties yourself by remixing the [Hubs Modular Art Gallery](https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/jOIjUE0/hubs-modular-art-gallery)

With the [Hubs Modular Art Gallery open in spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke/projects/new?sceneId=jOIjUE0), letâ€™s try to add a new wing for our participants to explore. Â Enable the west hall, delete the walls and add to our nav-mesh to make sure people can explore the new wing of our gallery.

You can try adding _?debugNavmesh_ to the end of any room URL to see a wireframe version of the nav-mesh in that space.

The nav-mesh is a critical part of the experience for many spaces in Mozilla Hubs. To learn more about advanced nav-mesh techniques check out this creator labs post: [Creating a Custom Nav Mesh](__GHOST_URL__/creating-a-custom-nav-mesh-for-your-hubs-scene/) to meet your needs.
