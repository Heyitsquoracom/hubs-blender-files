We're excited to announce the launch of our new 'Starter Plan'!

'Starter' is a new free tier of our managed subscription service, designed to give you more control, agency, and ownership over your immersive web experiences. Our mission has always been to make immersive web technology accessible to everyone and champion the open web. The introduction of the Starter Plan is a monumental milestone on this journey, granting free access and control over our innovative, open-source platform to users worldwide.

Last November, [we launched our Early Access subscription service](__GHOST_URL__/mozilla-hubs-early-access-release/), a robust solution that was simpler and more cost-effective than a Hubs Cloud instance. This was a huge leap forward, but we knew we could do more to extend the benefits of 3d web social spaces to a broader audience.
