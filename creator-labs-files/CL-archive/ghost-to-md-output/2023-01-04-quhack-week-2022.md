Hack Week is a chance for the Hubs team to work on any ideas they would like to pursue for a whole week. These ideas can involve a new tool or technology to explore, a new feature, a process improvement, or anything else that has the potential to improve Hubs.

Ideas are pitched within the team and groups spend the week working towards making the idea a reality. All ideas that get selected end with a deliverable: a design artifact, proof of concept, or something we can continue to build from. Below we will take a look at a few of the ideas pitched and some of the results of the Hubs Team Hack Week.

**Demos and designs are unfinished works in progress and not necessarily a part of the Hubs roadmap.**

### Idea Pitches

We saw a wide variety of ideas pitched from motion-sickness-friendly third-person modes, AI integrations, avatar visual fidelity controls, to Hubs Discord integrations and more.

### Results

After the week was up, the various groups briefly demonstrated what they had worked on.

Here is what the team came up with...

**Large Event Auto Load Balancing**
Create the logic for balancing participants between rooms which have been manually generated and specified by an event host with only one event URL.

**Portals**
The 3D web allows us to make this experience more natural and immersive so why not walk through a portal instead of clicking on an image? Make traveling across worlds a more interesting and pleasant experience.

**Enhancements to 3D Object Browser**
