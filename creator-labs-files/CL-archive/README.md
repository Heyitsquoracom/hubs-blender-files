## Creator Labs Archive

This archive is composed of Creator Labs data exported from https://hubs.mozilla.com/labs on May 17, 2024 before the shutdown of Mozilla-run Hubs servers completes on May 31, 2024. Like all other files in this repo, this Creator Labs data has been released with [a Creative Commons License](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-blender-files?tab=CC0-1.0-1-ov-file).

Creator Labs was built on the open-source blog platform [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

### About the Data

The [original Ghost export data](./creator-labs.ghost.2024-05-17-15-18-34.json) has been redacted to exclude all posts in "draft" status, as well as the encrypted passwords and email addresses of authorized writers. This data can be rehosted on the ghost platform.

In order to improve accessibility, we have used [this open source script](https://github.com/hswolff/ghost-to-md) by @hswolff to create markdown versions of each of the published blogs in [./ghost-to-md-output](./ghost-to-md-output). There are some flaws in the formatting, however at time of publishing we believe that this all blogs are in a legible state.

We have also scraped all post images from hubs.mozilla.com and hosted them in [./ghost-to-md-output/content](./ghost-to-md-output/content). We used [this script](./ghost-to-md-output/scrape-files.sh).
